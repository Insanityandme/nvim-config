# nvim-config
This is a one file neovim config file that has everything I need for getting up and running in neovim

## Linux
1. Change nvim.lua to init.lua and add it to your ~/.config/nvim folder
2. Create a folder called colors in ~/.config/nvim and add gruvbox.vim in there
3. Create a folder called lsps in ~/.config/nvim and add your LSPS of choice in there (for me clangd.exe for example)
4. Don't forget to update neovim to atleast v0.9.4
5. Now it should be working as intended
